# Introduction

### What is PixiJS?

PixiJS is a rendering system that uses WebGL (or optionally Canvas) to display images and other 2D visual content. It provides a full scene graph (a hierarchy of objects to render), and provides interaction support to enable handling click and touch events. It is a natural replacement for Flash in the modern HTML5 world, but provides better performance and pixel-level effects that go beyond what Flash could achieve. It is perfect for online games, educational content, interactive ads, data visualization... any web-based application where complex graphics are important.
